    Cable bills in America have been on the rise, with the average household spending $64.41 a month or about $768 a year. The thing is, there are many cheaper alternatives available these days that will provide you with enough entertainment options for the entire family. You can try a third-party service such as Netflix, which costs $9.99 a month, Amazon Prime at $99 a year or Hulu Plus, which costs $7.99 a month.

    If you prefer to stick to television, but usually only watch the same few channels, you can still lower costs by buying a package of channels. Sling TV does a base package called “The Best of Live TV,” which is $20 a month and includes 19 of the most popular channels. Add-on packs are an extra $5 each per month, so you can tailor it to your family’s needs and still save money.
